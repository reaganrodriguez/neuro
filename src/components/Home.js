<h1>Welcome to neuroLOGIC</h1>
<p>
neuroLOGIC is an interactive website designed for medical students to
learn how to localize neurology lesions through patient history taking
and physical exam. Our website offers two interactive forms for students
to enter patient information and receive feedback on their localization
skills.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Interactive forms:</strong> Our website provides two
interactive forms - one for history taking and one for physical exam -
to allow students to practice localizing neurology lesions in a
structured and interactive way.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Summary:</strong> After completing the form, students can download a summary of their history taking or physical exam.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Accessible:</strong> Our website is accessible from anywhere
with an internet connection, making it easy for students to practice
and improve their skills at their own pace.

</ul>
<h2>Get started</h2>
